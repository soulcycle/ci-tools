## Travis.yml Example

This repository includes an travis.example.yml file. This file is provided for reference only. It includes comments explaining the different sections of the travis build and provides in certain cases alternate features that we are not currently leveraging in the [podium-w77](https://github.com/soulcycle/podium-w77) repository that the example file is based off of.
